    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I was born in Provo, UT in the summer of 1998. I spent most of my childhood and adolescence in Spanish Fork, UT,
        where I graduated from high school in 2016. There I gained an interest in many hobbies, including snowboarding,
        guitar (click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7La8EptbhqUCy6DXSrKSWK">here</a> to listen to my high
        school band), photography, weightlifting, and martial arts, which I still enjoy today. After graduation, I spent
        two years in Chile (el país más hermoso del mundo) performing religious service, where I learned to love the
        people and cultures of other countries and developed proficiency with the Spanish language. I returned from
        Chile in 2018, just weeks before beginning fall semester at Brigham Young University.</p>
    <p>When I was young, my mother worked from home as a children's book illustrator (I'm sorry to say that I inherited
        little of her artistic talent). My father has spent most of his career working in the software industry (while
        also pursuing a variety of side projects). I gained my first real exposure to computer code at about ten years
        old, when my dad taught me how to write a webpage in html. The potential of new technologies and software, from
        self-driving vehicles to mobile applications, amazed me throughout high school, and I decided to pursue a career
        in Computer Science. I enrolled in the computer programming courses offered at my school and found an internship
        doing QA automation with C# after my junior year of high school.</p>
    <p>I currently attend Brigham Young University, pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science with a business
        minor and an emphasis in data science. I serve as a Vice President for the <a href="https://dev.byu.edu">BYU Dev
            Club</a>, and anticipate graduation in April 2022.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Twitter Clone</h3>
    <h5><em>Undergraduate Coursework</em></h5>
    <p>For a high level software design course project I created a mock twitter application for Android devices, which
        allowed a user to register (with a profile picture), login/logout (with session authorization), post/view
        "tweets", and follow/unfollow other users.</p>
    <h3>Family Map</h3>
    <h5><em>Undergraduate Coursework</em></h5>
    <p>This project entailed an Android client in conjunction with a small custom server, each written in Java. The
        custom
        server communicates with a SQL database for persistent data. The primary activity of this application shows a
        map
        of all of the user's ancestors, indicated by pins on a Google Map activity, connected to each other by lines of
        different colors to indicate the relationship of that ancestor. The user can use filters to indicate which
        ancestors
        should appear on the map activity. The application included user registration, login, and session management.
